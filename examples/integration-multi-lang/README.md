# Multi Language Integration Example
A `RpcServer` in Rust and a `RpcClient`s in Typescript requesting the Book service defined in `./api.proto`. This works for TCK (Technology/Test Compatibility Kit) since there can be a RpcClient using the Typescript implementation querying a RpcServer using the Rust implementation.
